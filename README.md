## What?
It's a little polling script to tell me when PeanutButter publications have actually gone public.

## Why?
[I scratched an itch](https://twitter.com/JonathanPeppers/status/1361341846593687552)

## Who cares?
Only me - but perhaps you find that you can fork this and watch something you're interested in

## Usage
```
npm ci
npm start
```

will notify via node-notifier, supported on lots of platforms.
